# Unsupervised Learning Summary

In this directory, we have two notebooks:

1. **k-means.ipynb**: This notebook implements an unsupervised learning approach using the K-Means clustering algorithm.
   
2. **other_clustering_benchmarks.ipynb**: This notebook contains additional clustering methods that were explored but ultimately abandoned. The benchmarks from these methods failed to meet the expected criteria, unlike K-Means, which proved to be more reliable.
